<sub>Last updated May 8, 2023 || Valid for Geely Coolray SE Sport 2023 Philippine Variant
</sub>

**A straightforward guide for installing Android apps on the Geely Coolray Philippine variant and other vehicles running GKUI on Android 4.3.**

**DISCLAIMER:** Do at your own risk, I will not be liable for any void in warranty, damage, or user error that properly or improperly following this guide may cause to you, your head unit, or vehicle.

This guide is a fork of the **[GCR Basic HU Installation Guide](archive/)** initially [posted on the Facebook group Geely Coolray Owners Club PH](https://www.facebook.com/groups/413459579568531/posts/1319384782309335/).

The installation script packaged along this was originally derived from Russian development [forums](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1001500&st=600#entry107246765) and [Telegram groups](https://t.me/CoolRay_Android_Develop/60768) with the same vehicle model, then modified by Filipino developers to work on the local variant.

####Test Unit
This was tested to be working on a **Geely Coolray SE Sport 2023** purchased in May 2023 running **Android 4.3 Jelly Bean**.
Confirmed working Android Auto client devices (wired and wireless) were tested with a Galaxy S23 running Android 13 and Galaxy S10 running Android 12.
