The guide in this page is a fork of the **[GCR Basic HU Installation Guide](archive/)** initially [posted on the Facebook group: "Geely Coolray Owners Club PH"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/413459579568531/posts/1319384782309335/) updated with the newer version of specific apps and with a more comprehensive overall guide.

The installation script packaged along this was originally derived from Russian development [forums](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=1001500&st=600#entry107246765) and [Telegram groups](https://t.me/CoolRay_Android_Develop/60768) with the same vehicle model, then modified by Filipino developers to work on the local variant.

If you want to learn more about modding in general, feel free to check the Telegram groups (be ready with the endless use of Google Translate), but be vigilant of the files you download / install.

I personally did not work on any of the files / scripts / apks posted, credit to the owners and authors of the file. This merely serves as a guide and is a fork of the pre-existing guides. Will be updating this over time.
